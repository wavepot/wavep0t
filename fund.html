  <h2>community funding</h2>

  <p class="details">
    development is split into milestones on which the features are
    discussed and decided upon in the <a target="_blank" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wavepot">mailing list</a> with the help of the community.<br><br>
    a funding campaign is then setup for each next milestone which supports
    development and keeps the project up and alive.<br><br>we are looking at a blank canvas. everyone is invited to contribute in any way they feel so and all suggestions are welcome and appreciated.
    <a target="_blank" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wavepot">join the discussion</a> now and let's build together the sweetest audio platform ever!

    You are seeing the original wavepot, the untouched version 0.

    wavepot was and is my love project. There was a version 1 and then a version 2 and then a version 3 (and then another?).

    None of them really worked properly, and none ever had the raw playground feeling that you get with this version.

    This popup orignally had a fundraiser, which i had put up to help fund the development. I had set a goal of $2000 and
    i didn't really expect it to ever reach it. It was reached within a single day after i published it on Hackernews.
    I couldn't believe my eyes. Suddenly i was tasked with building the next milestone for wavepot and I didn't have to
    worry about money. I tried, and i failed. I put way too many features on the roadmap and delivered them all poorly.

    There were bugs and the playground feeling was gone. It was ugly.

    They were all failed attempts at building something greater.
